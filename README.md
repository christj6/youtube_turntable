The two videos on one page was used to solve a problem found in an earlier attempt at a similar Youtube-based application (http://www.tcnj.edu/~christj6/youtube/yt.html) where pressing the 'a' button to return to an earlier spot in the video created a pause in the audio, because the video needed to load the location and start playing it. With 2 videos, one can play while the other pauses. A boolean variable is used to keep the videos alternating between each other when the 'a' button is pressed.
